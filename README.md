# Electronics projects

## Description
This is a repository of my electronic projects. This is to reorganize all the different repositories. The goal is to document all projects 
with both code, analysis and schematics. Completed does not mean it won't be updated, I might come back and update the projects if I feel like it.

It will take some time to document all projects and add proper documentation. 

## Documentation
The documentation is updated at
https://kjetilfjellheim.github.com/electronics_projects

## Goals
The goal is to eventually document all ICs, circuits and microcontroller code done here. I also plan to go back to relearn some of the electronics stuff I
have forgotten.
